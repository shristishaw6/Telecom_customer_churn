# Telecom_customer_churn
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a telecom company to identify key factors influencing customer churn and to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the company.

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, and early prediction helps businesses improve retention strategies, reduce revenue loss, and enhance customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objective

Analyze customer behavior and service usage patterns

Identify key factors contributing to churn

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction

Provide actionable business insights

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data Cleaning & Manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning Models

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains telecom customer details such as:

Customer demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents)

Services subscribed (Phone Service, Internet Service, Streaming Services)

Account information (Contract Type, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Total Charges)

Churn status (Yes/No)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked missing values and handled inconsistencies

Analyzed churn distribution

Identified relationships between contract type and churn

Observed higher churn in month-to-month contracts

Visualized impact of internet service and payment methods

📈 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn

Higher monthly charges increase churn probability

Customers without long-term contracts show higher attrition

Fiber optic internet users showed relatively higher churn
